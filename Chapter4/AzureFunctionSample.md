## Order processing scenario using Azure Functions
To implement the described workflow for the EparaMed online drugstore using Azure Functions, we can design a series of functions that interact with Azure Service Bus, Azure Storage Tables, and Microsoft Outlook. Each function will handle a specific part of the order processing flow. Here's an outline of how these functions can be structured:
## 1. Order Reception Function

-   **Trigger**: Service Bus Queue Trigger
-   **Functionality**:
    -   Receives new order messages from the application.
    -   Separates orders into two categories: those requiring topic submission and others.
    -   Sends product orders to a Service Bus topic and other orders to a different queue for further processing.
-   **Outputs**: Messages sent to appropriate Service Bus topic or queue. 


## 2. Order Categorization Function

-   **Trigger**: Service Bus Topic Trigger
-   **Functionality**:
    -   Triggered by new messages in the Service Bus topic.
    -   Uses topic subscription rules to filter orders by category.
-   **Outputs**: Categorized orders are routed to appropriate subscriptions.

## 3. Price Calculation Function

-   **Trigger**: Service Bus Subscription Trigger
-   **Functionality**:
    -   Triggered by messages in specific topic subscriptions.
    -   Retrieves product prices from an Azure Storage Table.
    -   Calculates the total price of the order.
-   **Outputs**: Order price information.

## 4. Invoice Generation and Notification Function

-   **Trigger**: Custom (could be HTTP or Queue Trigger based on previous function output)
-   **Functionality**:
    -   Generates an invoice based on the calculated price.
    -   Sends a notification to the customer with product details and invoice.
    -   Utilizes Microsoft Graph API to send emails via Microsoft Outlook.
-   **Outputs**: Email sent to customer with invoice and order details.

## Sample Azure Function Code (Price Calculation Function)

Here's an example of what the Price Calculation Function might look like in C#:
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.ServiceBus;
using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Table;
using System;

public static class PriceCalculationFunction
{
    [FunctionName("PriceCalculationFunction")]
    public static async Task Run(
        [ServiceBusTrigger("orders-topic", "price-calculation-subscription", Connection = "ServiceBusConnection")] string orderDetails,
        [Table("ProductPrices", Connection = "StorageConnection")] CloudTable productPricesTable,
        ILogger log)
    {
        var order = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Order>(orderDetails);
        double totalPrice = 0;

        foreach (var item in order.Items)
        {
            var retrieveOperation = TableOperation.Retrieve<ProductPriceEntity>("Product", item.ProductId);
            var result = await productPricesTable.ExecuteAsync(retrieveOperation);
            var productPrice = result.Result as ProductPriceEntity;
            totalPrice += productPrice.Price * item.Quantity;
        }

        // Further processing for invoice generation and notification...
        log.LogInformation($"Total price for Order {order.OrderId}: {totalPrice}");
    }
}

In this code, the function is triggered by messages in a specific Service Bus topic subscription, retrieves product prices from an Azure Storage Table, and calculates the total order price.

For this workflow to function smoothly, you need to set up Azure Service Bus with the necessary queues and topics, Azure Storage Tables for storing product prices, and configure Microsoft Graph API for sending emails via Outlook. Additionally, proper error handling, logging, and security measures (such as securing connection strings and managing access permissions) should be implemented.
